## ðŸš€ Project

The project consists of creating a React application that interacts with the user for CPF validation.

<br>

The logic for the CPF validation used in the project was based on the fact that a CPF number consists of 11 digits, the first 9 are the base numbers, and the last 2 are the so-called check digits, which are used to validate if the base 9 numbers are correct.

- The first validation performed was to multiply each base number separately, starting with 10 and ending with 2 and reserving the sum of the total of each multiplication in an accumulator;

- Afterwards, reserved the rest of the division of the result of that sum by 11;

- If the remainder of the division is greater than 9, the first digit will be 0, if not, the digit will be the remainder of the division.

- The second digit to be validated will be the difference between number 11 and the first digit;

- Finally, a validation is performed between the final number with the last digits and the typed number and a return to the user is printed on the screen.
